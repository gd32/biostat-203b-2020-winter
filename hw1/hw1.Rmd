### Question 2.3

The provided bash code:

```
for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
  do
    ls $datafile
  done
```

Provides the direct file path of the files located in the /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ directory.

The number of lines in each csv file can can be generated with the following code:

```
for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
  do
    awk 'END { print NR }' $datafile
  done
```

which returns:

```
58977
34500
7568
1048576
573147
4485938

### Question 2.4

Display the first few lines of ADMISSIONS.csv with: `head /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv`

From `awk 'END { print NR }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv`, there are **58977** lines in ADMISSIONS.csv.

The number of unique patients in the dataset can be given by `awk '{print $2}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sort | uniq | wc -l`. There are **58768** unique patients.

To obtain the possible values for each category, we can use `awk -F ',' '{if (NR!=1) {print $10}}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sort | uniq` and change the column number. Thus for column 10 `INSURANCE` the possible values are:

After running this code:

```
for character in "Elizabeth" "Jane" "Lydia" "Darcy"
  do
    grep -oE $character pride_and_prejudice.txt | wc -l
  done
```

We obtain:

```
"Elizabeth" - 634
"Jane" - 294
"Lydia" - 170
"Darcy" - 417
```
Thus Elizabeth was the most mentioned.

### Question 3.2

The command `echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt` overwrites anything in the file `test1.txt` with the text "hello, world".  The other command `echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt` appends the text "hello, world" to the file `test2.txt`.
